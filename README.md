# Competitive_Programming_Codes
Code 1 : In an array, you have to insert all the possible absolute differences of the array elements (inluding the absolute differences of the newly added members). Then you have to find the kth largest element of the new array. <br><br> 
FizzBuzz.java : You Iterate from 1 to n. You print Fizz, for numbers which are multiples of 3. You print Buzz, for numbers which are multiples of 5. You print FizzBuzz for numbers which are multiples of 3 and 5 both. You print the number as it is, for all other cases. <br><br>
isPalindrome_int.java : You have to check whether a given integer is a palindrome or not. <br><br>
power.java : Function to calculate x raised to the power n. Here n is an integer. <br><br> 
visitingCities.cpp: There are N cities in a row. You have a car and want to visit the cities in it, but unfortunately, the car has no fuel. Some of the cities have gas stations. You are given a string s on lenght N where s[i]='1' if the ith city have a gas station and s[i]='0' if not. Given K, the maximum fuel capacity of your car. The fuel consumption of traveling between two adjacent cities is exactly 1 unit. Find the number of cities that are possible to visit if you can start your journey at any gas station. <br><br> 
NonShading.cpp: There is a grid with n rows and m columns. Some cells are colored black, and the rest of the cells are colored white.

In one operation, you can select some black cell and do exactly one of the following:

color all cells in its row black, or
color all cells in its column black.
You are given two integers r and c. Find the minimum number of operations required to make the cell in row r and column c black, or determine that it is impossible. <br><br>
